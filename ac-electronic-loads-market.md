<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Electronic Loads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Loads</li><li>Non-Linear Loads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The AC electronic loads market is categorized into linear and non-linear loads. Linear loads exhibit a direct proportional relationship between voltage and current, representing traditional devices like resistors and incandescent lights, resulting in a pure sinusoidal current waveform. Non-linear loads, on the other hand, draw current in a non-sinusoidal manner, often due to devices like computers and LED lights, which can distort the electrical waveform and introduce harmonics. Both types impact power quality and energy efficiency differently in various applications.</p></p>
